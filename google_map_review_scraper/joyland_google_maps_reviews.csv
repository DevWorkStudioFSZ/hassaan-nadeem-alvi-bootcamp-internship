"Excellent park for children with both outdoor rides and indoor activities in the Super Space area. This indoor area has many interesting games especially Trampoline for jumping lovers.
Among the outdoor activities, Capital Eye is a good option for all ages.
Staff is also nice and very cooperative.
It is really worth visiting for fun especially the Super Space area."
Good place to spend few hours with kids especially if they are above 12 years of age as most of the fun rides are for kids above this age. Sufficient parking is available and preferably you should visit on weekdays.
"Joyland is a fantastic spot for the whole family!
A very cool and exciting place for kids with plenty of fun activities to keep them entertained. It’s not just for children—youngsters, adults, and even elders will find it a refreshing and enjoyable experience. The atmosphere is safe, clean, and family-oriented.

What really sets Joyland apart is the crowd—you’ll find decent families and respectful visitors, not the usual “lafanter type” you might worry about in public spots. A perfect combination of fun, comfort, and peace of mind. Highly recommended for a weekend outing or family hangout! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🎢🎠"
"A well made and maintained fun area for kids. Ample parking space, easy to get tickets, reasonably priced, and new so rides are all operational and in best condition. Snack shops available at multiple spots as well. An indoor play area as well with multiple options for children of all ages. It’s wheelchair/stroller accessible but not wheelchair/stroller friendly like most places in Pakistan."
Had a really good experience at Joyland! The kids absolutely loved the rides and had a great time. A fun place for families to enjoy together
"My Experience at the Sports Pavilion

I recently visited a sports pavilion, and it turned out to be an amazing day filled with fun and energy. The atmosphere was buzzing with excitement, and I tried out so many different games that kept me active and entertained.

I started with football, where I got the chance to kick around, test my aim, and enjoy the thrill of scoring goals. After that, I moved on to bowling, carefully aiming the ball and feeling the satisfaction each time I knocked down the pins. Then came snooker, which was a real test of focus and patience, lining up the shots and enjoying the calm challenge of the table.

For something more exciting, I jumped into the driving game, racing against time and feeling the rush of speed. After that, I tried Tekken, the classic fighting game, where I enjoyed the quick moves and combos in a friendly competition.

Meanwhile, the kids’ play area was full of laughter and joy, creating a fun environment for families and making the whole pavilion feel lively and welcoming.

By the end of the day, I felt refreshed and happy, having experienced a mix of physical sports, indoor games, and digital fun all in one place. It was a memorable outing that balanced relaxation, competition, and pure enjoyment."

"Joyland is full of joy and adventures. The venue best timing of arriving is evening (Maghrib) time. Superlative for family, friends, and kids. Prices are reasonable, especially if you buy a 1100Rs full package per person. You can use all the things that you like in Joyland. On the other hand, if you separately buy any specific ""jola"" etc, you may pay 300 to 350 Rupees. So, for me, the 1100Rs package was suited; that's why I can only suggest to you. 😉"
"Excellent fun park for family and kids.
The best part is it is very spacious and rides have a good distance between them.

The band for all rides is 1,000 and 100 entry fee per person."
"Joyland is a fantastic place for a fun day out, and the unlimited rides ticket is a great deal very reasonable and worth it! There’s a great variety of attractions for all ages, and the atmosphere is lively. It’s a great spot for families and friends, and I’d definitely recommend a visit! 👍😁"

"Joyland was lit! 🎠 Had a minor freakout on the DISCOVERYYY when the lights went out, but ride worked fine and staff were on it. 4.5/5 stars, would go back for sure 👍
All in all, would definitely recommend Joyland"

"When u come to Joyland, do not compare it to any amusement parks in the Western countries. But the options we have available in Pakistan, this is definitely the best amongst them. They have ghe option to pay for every ride, which costs from around 250 to 350 Rs. Or u can buy a band for 1100 Rs with unlimited rides. There is an entry fee of Rs 100. They have maintained it pretty well. They are constantly cleaning all the areas, trying to maintain queues, even the bathrooms are being maintained. Considering how the people throw around garbage, break queues, they are handling it all pretty professionally and courteously. A lot of variety in rides too. All in all a great place to take the kids of all ages."
Good place for children. Workers in food stall need lot of training. They misbehave. They always small bottle of water. Chat was pathetic. Uncooked potato and chickpeas.
"Much more to do for kids in reasonable prices, must recommend.
One thing I must point out that if you are paying for rides than they shouldn't charge for entry seprate, its not much but doesn't look good. Entry should be for ones not taking rides"
A best and entertaining place for children and  family to enjoy weekend and holidays ☺️

From thrilling games to family-friendly attractions, everything you need for a good outing is available here. Perfect place to enjoy with friends or family."
"Joyland is a very good park for young and kids equally. Offers nearly all electric swings. Cafeteria needs improvement. Sitting places needs to be improved. It is family gathering point, administration must look into providing comfortable, covered spaces with good sittings for elderly people.
Overall good experience. Rs 1100 for band is little expensive, they may offer a deal to families buying bands in bulk. Customize plan would also help in running all organs like swing, cafeteria and restaurants."
"A good place for enjoyment for both kids and elders.
Nice and spacious place."
"We put our daughter on the UFO swing and a man there said that your daughter's waist is small, you can't put her on it. Before that, we had put our child on the stove twice, in the UFO swing. The boy's name was Asad. We had a lot of arguments with him. He picked up our daughter and took her out of the stove. We complained to the office, and a female staff member came from there and she also didn't give us a good response. It was a very bad experience. This time, a lot of people gathered there, but no employee of the institution or any member of the staff helped us in this regard.
When we said we would mail it, the female staff supervisor said, ""Okay, you can do it however you feel like it."" Saying this, she also left from there. I don't know the name of the female staff supervisor, but the guy who was present at the UF was named Asad Asad.
And at this sentence, the boy Asad who was standing there had a guest. He was giving him full protocol and hospitality. I am attaching this small clip and Insha Allah I will also send him a mail and in which I will also add Punjab Parking Authority in CC."
"Joyland Rawalpindi is the perfect place for a fun family outing! 🎡🎢 The rides are exciting and well-maintained, with something for all ages from gentle kids’ attractions to thrilling free-fall and roller coaster rides. The wristband deal is great value for money if you plan to enjoy multiple rides. The park is clean, staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is full of energy. Food options are decent, though a bit limited still, the experience overall is fantastic. Highly recommended for an enjoyable evening, especially if you go on a weekday to avoid the crowds!"
It's was fantastic 😍 child was very enjoyed ☺️ staff was good behavior
Fantastic place for people of all ages. There are a lot of rides in the park. The bad thing is you need to wait in queues on a rush day for getting into your favourite ride apart from this the place is very lively and has an energetic atmosphere. A must go place for me if I am ever going to Rawalpindi for some fun time with family or friends.
"A vast and spacious park with multiple play zones catering to all age groups, featuring both indoor and outdoor rides, slides, and swings. The park offers ample parking space and thrilling attractions, including joint wheels and dragon swings. With separate parking and entry fees, visitors can choose from various bands to enjoy multiple rides, providing a diverse and enjoyable experience for all."
Joyland is best place for kids but too much expensive specially when you get indoors play area. So I will advise you to buy the bands with tickets for the kids which is very convenient as well as reasonable. So kids can enjoy each and every ride free
Joyland Rawalpindi is a really fun place for kids! There are many rides and games to enjoy. It’s a nice spot for families to spend some good time together.
Nice place to have fun with your family and kids but prices are high rides should be within budget of common citizen and very expensive food bought 2 walls choc bars with MRP of 50 PKR each but it costs me 200 instead of 100 .
"Little far from Rawalpindi main city areas and 30 to 40 mins drive from Islamabad,  expensive as 100 parking fee, 100 entry fee plus 1100 per head for unlimited rides bands. Kids under 10 allowed on barely v few rides which are slow and boring. Even for teens and adults rides are boring except one which I don't know name. Vibe is good. Staff and cleanliness is all right. Food is below average. Very busy, have to wait 15 mins atleast on a ride to get turn."
"Absolutely fantastic!✨ The rides were thrilling, the staff was friendly, and the park was impeccably clean. Perfect for families and thrill-seekers alike. A must-visit for a fun-filled day! Can't wait to return soon!💫"
"Entry price is 500 and the Joy band is 1000 rupees, or you could pay for the rides separately.
The rides are mixed for kids and adults so make sure to sit in appropriate one.

The rides were really fun, especially the spinning disc.

The place is really spacious so its a great place to go with family.

Also they have set up some places with attractions and lights to take photos for social media."

"Great place for almost all age groups
Fair prices of bands
Usually it is crowded but we luckily got no crowd....😃😃😃"
"New review:
Their outdoor band deal of Tuesday was awesome it was 1500 for 2 people and we really enjoyed our day.
Outside bumper cars are awesome we took them for 4 times. Full circle one was best as it was 1 min ride and it was slow not too fast we took it for 3 times. Train in water one was also good and we took that for 3 times.

Highly recommended.

Old review:
Joyland Park was really great. I specially enjoyed Bumping Car. I have been in love with bumping car from my childhood and I really loved it there. Ticket was for both Outside as well as inside games/Swings. I mostly played bumping car.

Other than that, Experience was quite good and all of the people there were really good.

Thanks Joyland Peeps."
"Good place for kids indoor activities
All rides available under 1 roof
Just a bit expensive for each ride you have to pay separately"
"Great place for kids, plenty of options to explore. Lots of rides are available and the best thing is buying bracelets which offer unlimited rides until the closing time. Only suggestion for the management is to offer guidance for first timers about indoor rides options and to explain  that there are separate tickets for some areas inside which is a strange thing to understand. Overall the trip was real fun for our kids."
A family amusement park having great rides. The safety is the priority for these guys. Rides are extremely enjoyable. Ticket price is also low. Staff is nice they greet and assist you in every way possible.
"Joyland is a fun and exciting place for games, rides, and family entertainment. Great for kids and adults alike — perfect for a joyful day out!"
"Joyland is a popular amusement park in Rawalpindi, offering fun and entertainment for people of all ages. It has exciting rides, swings, and games for children, as well as food stalls and seating areas for families. The park is especially lively on weekends and holidays, attracting visitors from the city and nearby areas. Its joyful atmosphere makes it a favorite place for recreation and family outings."
"Joyland: An amusement park with a 4.4-star rating, it offers thrill rides, an indoor gaming arcade, and mini-golf. Visitors appreciate the variety of activities and the option to purchase a wristband for unlimited rides. However, some reviews mention concerns about basic facilities like washrooms."
"Car entry is 100
Ticket per person is 100
Wristband 1100
There are a variety of rides for kids to enjoy  and a good thrill for adults too.
But don't go on Sunday, there is too much of a rush....We couldn't even try some rides due to the rush."
"Joyland Rawalpindi provides good entertainment, particularly for teenagers, though the options for children under 10 are somewhat limited.

One notable issue is the entrance ticket, which is priced at 100 PKR per person. This fee is separate from the bands, which start at 1000 PKR. It would make more sense if the entrance fee was included in the price of the bands, as buying it separately feels unnecessary.

Additionally, if you want access to the indoor area, you'll need to purchase a separate band, which adds to the overall cost.

Despite these points, the staff is very friendly and welcoming, greeting children with a Salam and a smile, which adds a nice touch to the experience.

A key improvement could be better information at the entrance, guiding visitors to choose the right bands based on their needs.

Overall, Joyland is worth visiting, especially for older kids and teens, but a more streamlined pricing structure could enhance the experience."
"Evenings are especially enjoyable with colorful lights and a more festive vibe. However, it can get very crowded on weekends and public holidays, so weekdays are often a better choice for a more relaxed visit."
Good place. Ample of parking. Near to almost all parts of Rawalpindi. Have lots of options for all family members. Rides are in good shape. Staff is very helpful and professional. U gets all types of rides and entertainment for all ages at a single place. Must visit with band so as to get more chances of playing. Super space is very well maint. Have lots of rides for all ages. Kids have separate places to enjoy.
"1100 tickect for the wrist band, which have access to almost all rides. 100 entry ticket is separately taken as well, whether you have wrist band or not. It is unjust. BTW children use to enjoy a lot. Weekend after eid is toooooooooo busy. Do not go after eid, it will ruin your day."
"Excellent place for kids , great options of fun activities for kids
100 Rs entry fee
1000 for each band , on which a single kid can have different rides from 4 PM to 12 AM.
A good family park"
