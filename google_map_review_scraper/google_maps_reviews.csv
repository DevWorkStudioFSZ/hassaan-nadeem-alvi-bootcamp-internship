Review
"Sure! Here’s a nice review of The Monal Rawalpindi in English from your side:

I recently had the pleasure of visiting The Monal in Rawalpindi, and I must say it was a truly delightful experience. The ambiance was elegant and peaceful, perfect for enjoying a meal with family or friends. The rooftop view added a refreshing touch, especially during the evening hours.

The food was excellent—well-cooked, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Every dish I tried had a unique taste, and the service was also top-notch. The staff was polite, professional, and attentive to our needs throughout the visit.

Overall, I would highly recommend The Monal Rawalpindi to anyone looking for a quality dining experience in a relaxing and classy environment. It definitely lived up to its reputation!"
"Tried their Chinese, Pakistani and french platter. In their Chinese platter- chowmein was good. Enjoyed the fried rice and Manchurian but the drumstick was too dry. Didn't like it at all. Pakistani platter was good. But the french platter was heavenly. Didn't like the beef steak. But the pasta was good. In dessert brownie was hot and the chocolate syrup was poured over which was not good 4/10 it should be served cold. Gloab jaman was okay too"
Recently visited Monal Rawalpindi. Food was good not only good in taste and also in quantity. Ambience was peaceful with live music on roof top. Its a good place to visit with family and friends.
"I recently visited HI Tea for their hi-tea (high tea) buffet and was absolutely blown away by the quality and variety. This was, without a doubt, one of the best culinary experiences I've had.

The Food: A Culinary Standout

The star of the show was undoubtedly the savory section. A few dishes were so exceptional they deserve special mention:

· The Fish: Perfectly cooked – flaky, moist, and seasoned beautifully. It was a highlight.
· Mutton Kabab: Incredibly flavorful and tender. The spices were well-balanced and it was cooked to perfection.
· Boneless Chicken: Another outstanding item. It was juicy, well-marinated, and delicious.
· Rice: Even the rice dish was notable, perfectly complementing the main courses.

But it wasn't just about the stars. Every single item on the buffet was good, showing a consistent level of care and quality across the entire spread. To top it all off, the dessert selection was also excellent, providing a sweet and satisfying end to the meal.
Pricing and Value

The all-inclusive hi-tea price was PKR 2,595. It's important to note the additional charges:

· A 5% service charge is applied.
· Payment by card incurs an additional 5% tax.
· Payment by cash incurs a higher 16% tax.

Highly Recommended! HI Tea delivers an exceptional hi-tea experience. From the outstanding main courses to the delightful desserts, every aspect of the meal was impressive. If you're looking for a top-tier buffet with incredible flavors, HI Tea is a must-try.

I will definitely be returning soon"
Had dinner on roof top... Open air felt good ... Excellent service n good atmosphere.. ordered chicken Karachi n thai soup with gola kabab ..
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Amazing Hi-Tea Experience at The Monal, Rawalpindi!

I recently visited The Monal, Rawalpindi for their Hi-Tea Buffet and it was a delightful experience! The food was excellent, with a huge variety of dishes that catered to every taste.

The Chinese section was flavorful, with perfectly cooked noodles and crispy appetisers. The BBQ station served juicy, well-marinated kebabs and grilled meats that were simply irresistible. And the Desi food was the highlight—rich, aromatic curries and tender meat dishes that felt like homemade goodness.

The dessert selection was the perfect ending to the meal. The pastries, cakes, and sweets were fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. The service was also attentive and friendly, making the whole experience even better.

Overall, The Monal, Rawalpindi offers a fantastic Hi-Tea buffet with high-quality food, great ambience, and top-notch service. Highly recommended for food lovers!"
"I recently visited Monal Restaurant Downtown, and overall, it was a great experience. The ambience was beautiful — really a nice place to enjoy a meal with family. The staff were polite, though I feel they could do a little more to assist guests with accessibility or those who have excess weight, just to make everyone feel more comfortable.

The food was tasty, though personally a bit too spicy for me, but my family absolutely loved it! So in that sense, 10/10 for flavor and presentation.

However, one thing that did leave a slightly sore taste after leaving was the pricing. It felt a bit tricky — some hidden charges here and there, and even soft drinks were priced higher than expected, sometimes even more than some food items.

Monal is definitely worth a visit for the experience and taste, but I’d really suggest the management be more transparent with pricing. That would make the whole experience perfect!"
Food was average. No onions used in our curry so it wasn’t pleasant. Prices are very reasonable.
"Had Sehri buffet—the service was top-notch as always. Though there wasn’t much of a view, the ambience was pleasant and welcoming. Food quality was generally up to the mark, except for the Chinese dishes. Lots of variety in the menu which was great. Highlights included delicious mutton palak, mutton seekh kabab, Nutella French toast, and beef nihari. Pancakes could have been lighter and fluffier. Live stations offered freshly prepared omelettes, parathas, pancakes, and French toast. Overall, a good experience and recommended.

P.S. Please note that they charge an additional 5% as service charges, in addition to the 5% GST on card payment."
Place was nice. Staff was very cooperative. But food was really average. Went for Sunday brunch. But was disappointed with the food. Lot of variety but taste was average.
"Monal Restaurant has truly been my go-to place for the past 12–15 years, and it never disappoints! The wide variety of food is impressive — from traditional dishes to continental options, there’s always something delicious for everyone. The quality and quantity are consistently excellent, making it great value for money. The ambiance is lively yet comfortable, with a beautiful view that adds to the overall experience. The staff is always courteous, professional, and attentive, ensuring quick service every time. Prices are a little on the high end, but the taste and experience fully justify it. Whether it’s a family gathering, a casual outing with friends, or a special occasion, Monal has always been my first choice. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience!"
Food was alright but not as nice as it was hyped up to be. Service was really good though
"The Monal Rawalpindi is a popular dining destination known for its scenic views and delicious food. Situated in a beautiful location, it offers a perfect blend of natural beauty and a pleasant dining atmosphere.

The restaurant features a diverse menu with traditional Pakistani dishes as well as continental options, catering to different tastes. The food quality is generally good, with fresh ingredients and well-prepared meals.

Monal is also famous for its spacious seating, making it ideal for family gatherings and special occasions. The staff is attentive and courteous, enhancing the overall dining experience.

If you are in Rawalpindi and looking for a place with great food and stunning views, The Monal is definitely worth a visit."
"Family took me along to this famous establishment. We opted for the Chinese options and the soup was delightful. It was traditional in its ingredients and taste and the spice was spot on.

The mains (rice and sweet sour chicken) was top notch and a dish I recommend.

Four of us struggled to finish the food and it was well priced.

Cleanliness and toilets were first rate but the wait between dishes did take a while.

The coffee (cappuccino) hit the sweet spot at the end."
"Hotel Monal offers a delightful experience with its excellent seating arrangements and high-quality food that caters to diverse tastes. The services provided are exemplary, ensuring that guests have a comfortable and pleasant stay. However, one area where the hotel could improve is in providing dedicated space and amenities for children. Currently, there is no specific area designed with child-friendly features, which could be a drawback for families traveling with young ones. Overall, while Hotel Monal excels in many aspects, adding facilities for children could enhance its appeal to families."
Overall aesthetics were good and the food taste and variety of dishes were satisfactory. The pizza they serve is below par in buffet and their white tarragon chicken steak was good
"""Monal Restaurant Rawalpindi never disappoints! The variety of food available is absolutely impressive — there's something for everyone. Both the quantity and quality of the dishes are excellent, making it great value for money. On top of that, the staff is extremely courteous and professional. Their service is quick and attentive, which really enhances the dining experience. Highly recommended for a memorable meal with family or friends!"""

"I have been exploring the culinary scene of Rawalpindi and Islamabad for years, trying dishes from almost every well known restaurant in both cities. Yet, none have impressed me quite like Monal. It truly stands out as a gem in every aspect.

From the moment you step in, you’re greeted with warm hospitality and a welcoming ambiance. The service is exceptional professional, attentive, and genuinely courteous. The food quality is simply outstanding, with each dish prepared to perfection, offering a burst of flavors that reflect both skill and passion. The environment is elegant yet comfortable, making it ideal for any occasion, whether a casual gathering or a special celebration.

Every penny spent here feels more like an investment in an unforgettable dining experience. The combination of remarkable taste, flawless service, and a picturesque setting makes Monal not just a restaurant, but a destination you look forward to revisiting time and again."
"If I compare the rates of 2 person servings with a minimum of 3 dishes, Hi Tea Buffet is a better choice as at the same price you will get a number of dishes. Their serving is the best and the atmosphere is average. But the overall experience of the Hi Tea Buffet is good. Recommended if you're a foodie!"
"My dining experience at Monal Downtown was nothing short of exceptional. The BBQ variety was a highlight, and I must say it was perfect. The flavors were exquisite, and the grilled meats were cooked to perfection, leaving me craving for more. Additionally, I tried their Chicken Steak with White Sauce, which was also good. The chicken was tender, and the white sauce added a delightful creaminess to the dish. The ambiance at Monal Downtown was charming, providing a wonderful atmosphere for dining. The attentive staff made the experience even better. Whether you're in the mood for BBQ or a delicious Chicken Steak, Monal Downtown is a fantastic choice for a memorable meal."
"It's like a one stop shop for good food. Platters are really nice and well thought of. Prices of platers are also good enough.

You can go with your family 👪 and everyone will have something to order."
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting The Monal in Rawalpindi, and I must say it was a truly delightful experience. The ambiance was elegant and peaceful, perfect for enjoying a meal with family or friends. The rooftop view added a refreshing touch, especially during the evening hours."
"""I recently had the pleasure of dining at Monal Rawalpindi, and it was an exceptional experience. The ambiance was delightful, providing a serene atmosphere with a stunning view. The lunch menu offered a diverse range of delicious dishes, each prepared with precision and flavorful ingredients. The hi-tea spread was equally impressive, featuring a tempting assortment of snacks and teas. The staff was courteous and attentive, enhancing the overall dining experience. I highly recommend Monal Rawalpindi for anyone looking for a delightful culinary experience coupled with a breathtaking view."""
Fish was good. But mixed vegetables were not up to the mark. Kheer was also good
"I went their for Hi-Tea from 1pm to 3pm. There was so much Variety of food that i was unable to taste all of them. Their services, their taste , everything is upto the mark. Surely among best restaurants in Rawalpindi.

It is expensive though. Prices are souring high but worth it."
"Monal special salad is my first choice yummiest salad every time , mutton special karahi very good taste , chicken golla kabab very juicy taste amazing Lovit always first choice monal is the best sadar branch is but monal sohawa very good why you closed"
"Breathtaking views and a serene atmosphere. The food was delicious and the service was great. The staff was courteous and attentive. Overall, a delightful dining experience with an amazing view over the capital."
We had a Lunch . Chicken karahe and beef kabab and Lassi. We recommend to others too
"One of the best Lunch Cum High Tea Buffet of Islamabad, highly recommended and value for money

Food taste 10/10
Food Serving 10/10
Staff Cooperation 10/10

Only con is the seating space it's quite smaller otherwise all good 👍"
"Monal Saddar is a popular dining spot known for consistently delivering quality experiences, particularly with its famous Hi-Tea. The Hi-Tea menu is praised for its vast variety, freshness, and impeccable taste. Guests can expect a delightful range of savory and sweet items, including sandwiches, kebabs, samosas, chaat, desserts, and beverages, all curated to cater to diverse preferences. Each dish is well-prepared and served fresh, maintaining Monal’s high standards.

However, Monal’s Ramadan platters and deals are often criticized for not matching the quality of their regular offerings. Patrons have noted that the taste and freshness during Ramadan promotions sometimes fall below expectations.

Overall, Monal Saddar’s Hi-Tea stands out as an excellent option for food enthusiasts looking for a flavorful and satisfying experience. Its well-rounded menu and consistent quality make it a reliable choice, despite the mixed reviews on seasonal deals."

Terrible Experience – Especially the High Tea

This restaurant has seriously gone downhill. I recently tried their high tea, and it was a complete disaster. The food was pathetic  stale, tasteless, and clearly lacking any effort or quality. What used to be a decent spot has now become a huge disappointment. The snacks were cold, the presentation was poor, and nothing tasted fresh. If you're thinking about going here for high tea, don’t waste your time or money. Definitely not recommended."
"The staff is very polite, promt and well versed
They got my lunch right on time and were very compliant."
"Monal is one of those places that knows how to deliver a complete dining experience. Whether you’re going for the buffet or opting for their à la carte menu on the rooftop, you’re in for a treat. The buffet has a solid variety of options, so there’s something for everyone, no matter what you’re craving. If you’re heading to the rooftop, the live music adds a nice touch, especially if you’re there with family. Just a tip—sit a little further away from the singers to enjoy the vibe without it being too loud.

The food here is consistently great. The BBQ platter? Absolutely fantastic—juicy, flavorful, and perfectly grilled. And if you’re a dessert fan, do yourself a favor and order the sizzling brownie with ice cream. Watching it sizzle on the skillet and eating it straight from there? An experience in itself!

What really stands out, though, is the atmosphere. The rooftop seating with a view is perfect for a relaxing evening, and the service? Top-notch. The staff is attentive and makes sure you’re well taken care of, which is always a big plus.

Overall, Monal is a great spot whether you’re dining with family, friends, or even on a casual date. With good food, a welcoming ambiance, and excellent service, it’s definitely a place I’d recommend. Just make sure you come hungry—there’s a lot to enjoy here!"
"Had a chance for Dinner buffet, reserved on WhatsApp that was good.. wasn't rushy, cool ambiance.. a variety of dishes.. but taste was only average... Can't say extraordinary or mouth watering 🫡..
Plus point you can refill their welcome drink Mint margarita.. table per Jo bottle rakhty Hain usky charges elahda hoty hain,
Start py aap ko pizza offer kerty Hain table per na Khana awazar tha😐,
Sweet me kafi range thi... A lot to try with a chocolate fountain.."
The ambiance was great. Staff was cooperative. Buffet was big but all food was not fresh. But v v expensive.
"We recently visited the Monal Restaurant in Rawalpindi and had a wonderful dinner experience at their rooftop setting. The ambiance was stunning, with a beautiful view of the city skyline. We ordered the platter and chicken handi, which were both delicious and satisfying. The portion sizes were generous, and the flavors were well-balanced.

However, there was one aspect that detracted from our otherwise enjoyable experience - the music. Unfortunately, the volume was too loud and the selection was not to our liking. It was a bit jarring and made it difficult to carry on a conversation.

Despite this minor hiccup, we still had a great time at Monal Restaurant. The service was attentive, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooftop setting was truly special, making it a great spot for a night out with family or friends.

Rating Breakdown:

- Food: 4/5
- Ambiance: 5/5
- Service: 4/5
- Music: 2/5

Recommendation:

Monal Restaurant is a great option for those looking for a delicious meal with a beautiful view. Just be prepared for the music, or perhaps request a table in a quieter area. We would definitely visit again and recommend it to others."""
"Food Quality is superb and service quality is also 4/5 (means can be improved). Mutton is second to none, all other dishes are quite good and well served. Ambiance is not as good as Monal Pir Sohawa Road Branch, parking problem exists so if u r late, u may struggle finding parking space. Yes it is quite expensive"
"Went for Sehri with family. Food was delicious as usual. Great ambience on the third floor and the terrace at the top. Excellent service. The attitude of the staff ensured  a warm and welcoming experience. Great hospitality.

As compared to the Monal in Pir Sohawa, i found this a better place in terms of the quality of service. If the view is not the top priority, i would recommend this over the one at the hill."
"Had high tea at Monal Downtown and really enjoyed the experience. The spread included a variety of items, but the highlights were definitely the Thai chicken, chicken steak, and fettuccine pasta all cooked to perfection and full of flavor. Great ambiance and a satisfying variety overall."
"Very tasty food. They are a bit expensive but worth it. Tried various dishes and platters. Pakistani Platter is good. In Chicken, peshawari namkeen karahi is awesome. The staff specially manager knows his job pretty well."
"A restaurant at the hub of Rawalpindi main market place Saddar. The environment was quiet surreal especially the roof top. The menu list is very extensive, ranging from desi to continental to fast food as well and was delicious too. The staff was very obedient and quick. The live music was disturbing for many as one can't hear people sitting next to them. Instrumental can be a good alternative. Washrooms were gender separated and clean as well. The prices were reasonable. Car parking is manageable as well."
Very good hi-tea. It was crowded but still the atmosphere was ok. Food was awesome but they need to slightly improve their service.
"The food, ambiance, and service were excellent, as always. However, the table space was surprisingly limited. We were a group of five seated at a table meant for six, yet it was still difficult to manage our dinner comfortably. Even a single dinner plate felt cramped, and due to the shortage of space, we had to hold our bread in our hands. I also noticed that nearby tables seemed to be facing the same difficulty, which suggests this may be a recurring issue."
My all time favorite. Please add more platters and less oily food in your menu. Rest everything is fine. We ordered mutton karahi and Chinese platter both were superb. Will love to visit again as their quality of food is outstanding
"The Monal Rawalpindi offers a premium dining experience with breathtaking rooftop views and a luxurious ambiance. The menu features a wide range of delicious dishes, from traditional Pakistani cuisine to continental favorites, all prepared with top-quality ingredients. The staff is professional and attentive, service is quick, and the cleanliness is excellent. A perfect spot for family dinners, special occasions, and memorable evenings."
"Great experience with buffet
Everything was on point
Pre reservation is recommended
Buffet is great value for money
Everything had a fairly decent taste
Molten lava chocolate was not so thick it was watery which I didn't like
They should also add chocolate ice cream to menu
Music control was pour only played birthday song ( they should improve it)
Lights had issue and light went off for a couple of times"
"Its good restaurnt in the town. Rates are reasonable as compare to their competitors. Food quality is not what it was few months back.  Needs to improve, particularly BBQ. But overall, it good. Staff is cooperative."
"Last night we went for dinner, we ordered and waited for 20-30 mins and it was served. The management while serving food on the table was not less than a mess, Dum Biryani had only 2-3 chicken botis, taste was average, they charged for salad and raita and when I asked them to pack it because they were untouched, they didn’t pack it along the left over food but charged 1000 for it. Plus they also forgot to serve sweet which was included in the platter, upon asking, they served.
It was a pathetic experience"
"Worth visiting place for professional and family gatherings.
Best quality food and excellent environment, service is very good and behaviour of staff is friendly and appreciable.
Overall our official function is well managed and organised.
Weldone Team Monal."
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Monal Restaurant and I must say, it was an absolutely fantastic experience. The food was simply delicious, and the environment outstanding. The services were top-notch, making for an enjoyable evening all around. One of the things that stood out to me was the live music, which added a nice touch to the already great atmosphere.

While the prices were a little on the higher side, it wasn't too pricey considering the quality of food and the excellent service. Plus, the portion sizes were quite generous, so you definitely get your money's worth.

One of the highlights of the evening was the tasty brownie that we had for dessert. It was the perfect end to a wonderful meal, and I highly recommend trying it out.

What's more, the restaurant had a very family-friendly vibe, making it a great place to take the whole family for a night out. Overall, I highly recommend Monal Restaurant for anyone looking for delicious food, outstanding ambiance, and excellent service."
"I recently tried the hi-tea at Monal Downtown and was quite disappointed. The food quality did not meet expectations — many items lacked freshness and taste. Considering the high price, the overall experience felt like poor value for money. Definitely not worth it."
"Fantastic hi-tea buffet at Monal Restaurant Rawalpindi! Loved the Fried Rice, Chicken Chilli Dry, Silician Beef, Hot & Sour Soup, Pizza, Fruit Chaat, and BBQ. Delicious food and great service Highly recommended!"
"Initially, there were quite a few ups and downs in their taste and consistency, but now I can say they are offering good and authentic food options. The high-tea buffet is definitely worth trying, priced at 3,040/- (including tax with card). Pleasant seating arrangement, attentive service, and a nice ambience make the overall experience enjoyable."
"I hosted a hi-tea at Monal Restaurant for 130 guests as part of my wedding celebrations, and it was an exceptional experience. Mr. Kamran arranged a beautiful setup, and the peaceful ambiance, cleanliness, and delicious food were outstanding.

Special thanks to Mr. Kamran for personally overseeing every detail. The entire staff was professional, courteous, and attentive, ensuring a seamless event. I highly recommend Monal for any special occasion. The best thing about is they gave us voucher to have free hi-tea."
"Visited on 19 Feb 2022 at around 04pm for HiTea.

It has valet parking avbl and there's no fee but you can give 100rs.

Cost per head including tax for HiTea buffet is 1540 rs, which I guess is very reasonable because of their service and quantity.

Taste wise not all items are great.
But I think at the moment this is the only hi tea in twin cities that offers main course dishes e.g. Chicken Karahi, Mutton  Biryani (yes mutton), Daal Channa, Naan which you won't find in other hi tea.
Other items include, different salads, dahi bhalla, gol gappa, soups, gola kebab, fried fish, chicken wings, rolls, samosa, pakoora Chinese items etc etc etc. And a long long long range of desserts even icecream.
You get free complimentary drinks, don't have normal water bottle (1.5ltr) as its very expensive (150 rs without  of tax)
They also serve fresh baked pizza 🍕 slices and cheese naan on your table which is a sign of great service.

Tea, green tea, coffee option also available.

The place was crowded and noisy , so make sure you have a reservation well ahead.

TL:DR
Taste 07/10
Quantity 10/10
Service 10/10
Ambiance 07/10
Overall 07/10
HiTea serves Chicken, Beef, Mutton and Fish.

*Request: Pl don't waste food in hi tea, fill your plate only as much as you can eat. I have seen ppl wasting too much 👎*"
"Went to monal downtown,saddar. We ordered Chinese platter, pakistani platter and Chicken shots loaded fries. Firstly, the loaded fries were great (10/10). Not many places have good loaded fries but their loaded fries were surprisingly tasty. Next the chinese platter(6/10). The single best thing about this platter is a piece of brownie. Chowmein, chinese rice and Manchurian were okay-ish. But the drumstick in them were stale and they were smelling bad. We hadn’t even touched them. Pakistani platter was also okay-ish. Not much tasty (7/10). It had biryani, 1 pc tikka, 1 pc seekh kabab, chicken bharta, raita and Gulab jamun. Everything was average in this platter."
"Always love to visit Monal. Rich of balanced spices and enriched flavours. Thai platter is my favourite and hot brownie is love after platter. To have some sweat, hot and cold ending, Sizzling brownie with ice-cream is on next level."
